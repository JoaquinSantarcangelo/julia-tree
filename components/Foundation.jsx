              ORGIIS Ghana is an environmental and biodiversity conservation organization. We strive to reduce the impact of climate change, especially desertification and land degradation. Since 2016, ORGIIS has implemented a value chain approach to our tree planting programs. We are working in partnership with the African Union to deliver the Great Green Wall Initiative to increase tree cover and reduce desertification and migration. We are also creating green business opportunities. Women are the driving force of our interventions, through a cooperative model, creating green job opportunities. We focus on organizing women groups to build their capacity to mobilize agriculture products and we facilitate access to domestic and International markets. We also use inclusive Banking tools to facilitate the improvement of livelihoods to reduce pressure on the natural environment. ORGIIS uses a collaborative approach with likeminded individuals and Institutions to fight for the survival of our planet for current and future generations.
